SETUP

The website makes use of the cross-platform nanoc site generator: http://nanoc.ws/

From a blank Ubuntu 12.04 installation, you will need to:

sudo apt-get install ruby1.9.1-dev
sudo gem install nanoc kramdown nokogiri


BUILD

1. Edit config.yaml to select the directory for the website to be built.
2. From this directory, a simple "nanoc" will build the website.
