Welcome to the world of physical computing with the Raspberry Pi!

The [Raspberry Pi](http://www.raspberrypi.org) is a small, inexpensive, low-power computer aimed at getting children interested in Computer Science. It is, however, a very flexible machine, and its capabilities have made it very popular among makers and hobbyists, who see the Raspberry Pi as a cheap way of accessing a relatively large amount of compute power.

This website aims to teach you how to sense and control the physical world using computer programs running on the Raspberry Pi. Here you will learn how easy it is to interact with the outside world, and how this opens up limitless possibilities for exploration. A wide range of sensors, motors, robots and USB devices can be connected, of which only a few are introduced here.

## Getting Started

The tutorials on this site make use of the [Python](http://www.python.org) programming language. Python was designed to be easy to read and easy to learn, and is ideal for beginners and experts alike. There are many books and websites available to help you learn Python, including:

* [Codecademy](http://www.codecademy.com)
* [Invent with Python](http://inventwithpython.com)
* [Learn Python the Hard Way](http://learnpythonthehardway.org)

In order to use your Raspberry Pi, you will need a number of peripherals and cables, and an SD card with an operating system on it. For more details, see [Getting Started](/getting_started/). Many of the tutorials also require additional components. See each tutorial's page for further information.
