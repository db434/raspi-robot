## Using our custom image
This is the easiest way of getting up and running if you do not already have a Raspberry Pi installation, but the image is likely to be out-of-date compared to one you make yourself.

Download [our custom image](http://asbradbury.org/tmp/raspi/2012-08-20-workshop-libs.img.zip) to your computer (not your Raspberry Pi), then follow [these instructions](http://elinux.org/RPi_Easy_SD_Card_Setup#Easy_way) to write the image to your SD card.
-->

## Setting up your <!--own--> image
Download the latest Raspbian image from [Raspberry Pi](http://www.raspberrypi.org/downloads) and write it to your SD card using [these instructions](http://elinux.org/RPi_Easy_SD_Card_Setup#Easy_way).

Boot your Raspberry Pi up with a monitor and keyboard and your newly-written SD card. You should be greeted with the raspi-config screen.

Run expand_rootfs, change the overscan if there are black bars around the edge of the display, and make sure the ssh server is running by default then hit finish and reboot. Changing your password is also recommended.

You can do the rest via ssh if you wish: the IP address will be shown at bootup.

Log in (username: pi, password: raspberry). First let's do an update of the system with:

~~~
sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get upgrade

~~~

<a name="packages"></a>

## Installing extra packages

Now let's install some of the software packages we need to access external devices. In a terminal (Start > Accessories > LXTerminal):

~~~
sudo apt-get install python-smbus ipython bluetooth bluez-utils \
python-cwiid python-scipy python-numpy python-pygame \
python-setuptools libsdl-dev

~~~

## Installing custom libraries

Download our custom RPi.GPIO, i2c and image processing libraries:

~~~
wget http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/projects/raspberrypi/tutorials/robot/resources/RPi.GPIO-0.3.1a.zip
unzip RPi.GPIO-0.3.1a.zip
cd RPi.GPIO-0.3.1a 
sudo python setup.py install
cd ..

wget http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/projects/raspberrypi/tutorials/robot/resources/i2c.py
sudo mv i2c.py /usr/local/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/i2c.py

wget http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/projects/raspberrypi/tutorials/robot/resources/imgproc.zip
unzip imgproc.zip
cd library 
sudo make install
cd ..
~~~

We need to have the i2c modules loaded by default so remove them from the blacklist by commenting them out (insert `#` at the beginning of the following lines):

~~~
blacklist spi-bcm2708 
blacklist i2c-bcm2708 
~~~

in /etc/modprobe.d/raspi-blacklist.conf. Then add them in /etc/modules:

~~~
i2c-bcm2708
spi-bcm2708
i2c-dev
~~~

Make the Pi's Bluetooth discoverable on startup by opening /etc/rc.local and adding

~~~
hciconfig hci0 piscan
~~~

before `exit 0`.

To allow us to access i2c from userspace, add ourselves to the i2c group:

~~~
sudo adduser $USER i2c
~~~
